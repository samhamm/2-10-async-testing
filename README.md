Assignment for Code Fellows JavaScript Development accelerator (async testing and basic http)

For this assignment you should write an http server in vanilla node that responds to several different routes.

The server should respond to a request to /time that will send back the current time of the server.

It should also respond to a get request to /greet/name where name is any single word string. It should send back a string that greets that name.

There should be tests using chaiHTTP for both routes, as well as a Gruntfile/package.json
